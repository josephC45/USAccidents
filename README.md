# USAccidentMachineLearning
Supervised machine learning program meant for determining/classifying severity of car accidents across the US.

This is my first attempt at Data Analysis and Machine Learning using Python.

The dataset I am using is the US Accidents(3 million records) dataset from Kaggle.
